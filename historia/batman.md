# Batman

Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera;[a] with their forelimbs adapted as wings, 
they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. 
Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, 
is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 mm (1.14–1.34 in) in length, 15 cm (5.91 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (0.07–0.09 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, 
which can weigh 1.6 kg (4 lb)
and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).
